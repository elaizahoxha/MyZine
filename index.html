<section id="why" class="section light angled">
  <h2>Concept & Context</h2>
  <div class="two-col">
    <p class="text-large">
      Softness challenges the belief that vulnerability is weakness. Through collage, physical artifacts,
      memory, and interaction, I explored how design can communicate gentleness — not through fragility,
      but as <strong>relational intelligence.</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      “Softness becomes strength when it gives us space to be seen.”

  <div class="body">
    <p>
      This project emerged from class explorations of boundaries, care, and identity. I wanted to create
      a space where people could pause and feel held — without needing to perform or impress. The zine
      format helped me explore personal stories while designing with honesty and emotional grounding.
    </p>

<!-- SECTION: PROCESS -->
<section id="process" class="section dark angled">
  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <div class="split">
    <p class="body">
      My process began with physical making. Cutting, taping, layering and discovering meaning through
      touch. Rather than designing what I thought would look “right,” I created artifacts that reflected
      how I experience softness in my real life: as memory, care, and resilience.
      <br><br>
      I also designed with vulnerability. Sharing pieces with teammates, receiving edits, and learning
      to let others impact my work. This expanded the emotional weight of the final outcome.
    </p>

    <ul class="process-list">
      <li>Physical collage → texture, imperfection</li>
      <li>Digital adaptation → accessibility + longevity</li>
      <li>Group synthesis → merging perspectives</li>
      <li>Presentation refinement → communication through narrative UX</li>

<!-- SECTION: REFLECTION -->

  <h2>Reflection</h2>

  <p class="text-large">
    This project helped me understand how collaboration shapes product quality. 
  </p>

  <p class="body">
    Working individually first gave us a foundation, but the real progress happened when we developed trust and felt safe revisiting each other’s ideas. As our comfort level increased, our feedback became more honest and our decisions became more aligned.

    I learned that successful design depends on more than technical execution—it requires communication, shared context, and a team environment where people feel confident contributing. Small details in our collages became points of alignment, helping us clarify intent and build a more cohesive final experience. The process made me appreciate iteration not just as a method, but as a mindset.
